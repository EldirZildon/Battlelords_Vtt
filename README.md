Battlelords VTT
Please Note: This is a beta version of the game system. Item data may not be transferable across updates. The full version will be released for free at a later date. However, addons such as items and monsters will be sold in sets based on the companion books.

Known Issues:

Weapon type does not save the selected type.
Rolls for items are not calculating correctly.
Rolls for initiative do not account for character bonuses (Note: Initiative is intentionally flipped so that higher rolls go first, in line with Foundry's system).
Skill types do not always display.
The combat info tab occasionally deletes random information, often affecting the number of actions, but it can impact other data as well.
Please report any additional bugs in the designated Discord channel.

Updating

Updates to the game system will be rolled out as needed, with no set time frame. We aim to ensure quality and stability with each release. Large updates will be announced in the Discord channel, so be sure to stay connected for the latest news and improvements.
